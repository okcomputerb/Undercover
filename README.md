# Undercover Contract Deployment with Hardhat

This project uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to compile, test, and deploy an Ethereum smart contract named "Undercover". The contract is written in Solidity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd Undercover
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Setup

Configure your Hardhat project by editing the `hardhat.config.js` file to suit your needs. To deploy the contract, you will need to provide your own [Infura](https://infura.io/) key and account private key.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

## Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Ethereum network, run the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network YOUR_PREFERRED_NETWORK
```

Replace `YOUR_PREFERRED_NETWORK` with the name of the network you want to deploy to.
